Pseudocode :
 In this game an even number of cards are displayed on the board faced down. The player takes turns flipping a pair of cards.
If the flipped pair of cards match , then it is a win for the player and the cards remain open.
If the cards do not match, the selected pair of cards remain open for a few seconds and  flip back.
The player would get eight chances to win the game (pick all the pairs).
